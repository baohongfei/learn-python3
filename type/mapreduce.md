## Abstract
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.Users specify a *map* function that process a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a *reduce* function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper.
